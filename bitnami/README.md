July 2018 - What happened when I moved my website (stephaniemdavis.com) to aws lightsail. 
My site uses Wordpress so I chose to use the aws lightsail bitnami wordpress stack
I had problems installing the SSL certificate and had to reach out to bitnami for support. 
I'm attaching the general transcript of my support sessions. I blacked out sensitive info and included the secure copy protocol command line script for moving files between a local and cloud directory.
Great practical introduction to aws-lightsail-configuring nameservers, dns records, etc.
